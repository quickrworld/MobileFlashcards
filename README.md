# Readable App

To get started right away, choose an installation directory, for example, `installdir`.

* Create the installation directory
    - `mkdir installdir`

* Install the API server and readable app from the github repository
    - `cd installdir`
    - `git clone https://github.com/quickrworld/MobileFlashcards.git`
    - `cd MobileFlashcards`
    - `yarn install`
    - `yarn start`
    
* You can browse the app at `http://localhost:3000`

#### Note: `installdir` can be any directory where you want to install the frontend application and the API server
#### Note: You must have write permissions in the working directory when you create `installdir`
#### Note: Windows users may have to modify the commands for the Windows environment
